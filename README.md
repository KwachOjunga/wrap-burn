# Pyburn
---

A modern deep learning framework built to utilize your hardware.
Pyburn leverages the Burn framework to use a diverse range of backends.
In the current version it exposes the ndarray and wgpu backend. `pyburn` offers fusion capabilites
on both backends and allows for both inference and training.

Pyburn is still in its early phase but its foundations are well defined and mature.
There is more to come.
